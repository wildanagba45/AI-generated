Design a digital poster to educate the public about the potential and risks of using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in everyday life. The poster should highlight the benefits of AI, such as its application in healthcare, automation, and education, while also warning about potential risks, like data misuse, job loss, and unfair algorithms. Include a futuristic design with a robot or digital network imagery. Use blue, grey, and black colors with bright accents for emphasis. The font should be modern and clean, with bold text for the title and regular text for the body. Add a clear call-to-action encouraging people to learn more and use AI responsibly.
