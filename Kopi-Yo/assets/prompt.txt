A logo design depicting a steaming coconut cup filled with rich, golden coffee, presented on a clean white background. The cup is crafted from a halved coconut shell, showcasing its rough, natural texture and a single coffee bean delicately placed near the base. The text "Kopi Yo" is elegantly displayed in a faded, playful vintage font in a warm golden hue curving slightly around the cup. Soft, ambient lighting highlights the warm tones of the logo, creating a welcoming and inviting aesthetic suitable for a tropical coffee shop brand.
